<h1>Jigsaw Library Project</h1>
[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=cearceancieta_jigsaw-library&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=cearceancieta_jigsaw-library)

<p>
Jigsaw Library starts as a personal project to manage my own Jigsaw Puzzle Library. This is initially created to be used only by me and a handful of friends and family users. Once the MVP is done it will also serve as a place to practice and explore new technologies, tools and libraries.

<p>
This is the code source for the starting backend project. This will start as a monolith while the application is small. As this project grows it may be necessary to split this monolith into microservices or to create new microservices as clearly independent parts arise.
