<h1>Jigsaw Library Project</h1>
</br>
<p>
Jigsaw Library starts as a personal project to manage my own Jigsaw Puzzle Library. This is initially created to be used only by me and a handful of friends and family users. Once the MVP is done it will also serve as a place to practice and explore new technologies, tools and libraries.

This is the code source for the starting backend project. This will start as a monolith while the application is small. As this project grows it may be necessary to split this monolith into microservices or to create new microservices as clearly independent parts arise.
